# Seb's Currency Converter

This is a user-friendly and accessible currency conversion web app built with React. The app allows users to input an amount and select a currency to convert from and to. It then calculates the converted amount and displays the result. The input is validated to ensure proper user input and the app is built with accessibility in mind. 

To run the app
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. You can check the version by running the following cmd:
### `node -v` 
- Clone the repository by running the following command in CMD:
### `git clone [repository URL]`
- Navigate to the app directory using the following command:
### `cd [app directory]`
- Install the dependencies using
### `npm i`
- Start the development server:
### `npm start`
This will launch the app in the browser on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and you can start using it!

Alternativerly You can check out the hosted version of it using [this link](https://black-sand-034bc8103.2.azurestaticapps.net/)
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you also can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
